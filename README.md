# BBEdit
Welcome to BBEdit, a plugin-supporting and open-source BBCode editor.
For those unfamiliar with BBCode, it is a basic markup language used for styling most forum posts. It is, however, very complicated to write,
most forums don't have a WYSIWYG(Whay You See Is What You Get) editor for BBCode, meaning that _*you*_ have to write out all of those tags.

Because a lot of people don't know or don't understand BBcode, they cannot style their own posts.

### Enjoy!
